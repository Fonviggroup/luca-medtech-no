## What We Do

Luca MedTech is building DiaLuca — three modules in one application:

1. **DiaLuca - Familie** — Free for families and caregivers. Consolidated view of a child's blood sugar data, shared securely with grandparents, kindergarten, and school. Have data ready for the doctor's appointment without searching.

2. **DiaLuca - Assistent** — For staff in kindergartens, schools, and after-school care. Traffic-light display (green/yellow/red) with simple action instructions adapted to the child's treatment plan. Designed to alert contact persons. No medical background needed.

3. **DiaLuca - Klinikk** — For diabetes teams and clinicians. Designed to deliver CGM data directly into the patient record (DIPS), with population overview and consultation preparation.
